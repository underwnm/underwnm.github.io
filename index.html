				<p>I grew up in Stevens Point, Wisconsin and graduated from Stevens Point Area Senior High School. I went on to college at the University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire and studied multiple different degrees. These degrees ranged from Computer Science, and Actuarial Science. At UWEC I met my wonderful wife Mikala and we got married this last New Year Eve (12/31/15). It was an amazing celebration and we had over 350 guests attend. After the wedding I transferred to Penn State World Campus and was seeking a business degree with a financial emphasis. My wife started graduate school for Occupational Therapy at Concordia University in Mequon, WI. We ended up going on our honeymoon and coming back for her to start school the following week. We packed up all our wedding presents and moved to Port Washington, WI where we bought our Condo. I decided to transfer schools because this was an online school and I didn't want to be long distance with my wife right after marriage. While finishing my first semester was fun I felt like I wanted to continue with my computer science degree.</p>
				<br>
				<p>My new adventure is taking a coding bootcamp through DevCodeCamp in Milwaukee, WI. This was something I thought was very intriguing because the concept seemed like it could work from my past coding in college. My father and I talked it over as he was an senior software engineer for over 20 years. So far it has been a great experience as I already love learning on my own.</p> 
				<br>
				<p>Lastly a big part of my life is volleyball. I play in tournaments most weekend during the summer and leagues almost year round. Volleyball is the place that I have met most of my friends and I actually met my wife from the game of volleyball. It is not only very fun to play but it has a great community of people that have become a second family. When you go to a volleyball wedding or event it is almost like a reunion because you have so many people that you have something in common with.</p>
